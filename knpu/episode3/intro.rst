Introduction
============

Well hey friend! You've made it to part 3, so high-five a stranger and then
keep going!

In this episode, I want us to really start to learn how Symfony works under
the hood. We'll learn what a service is, find out more about the core Symfony
services and create a few of our own. In Doctrine, we'll create some ManyToOne 
and ManyToMany relationships. We'll also talk about lifecycle callbacks and 
event listeners. And there's a lot more that we're hiding in between all of 
these topics.

And you have been coding with me, right? If you have you should now feel comfortable
creating new classes, routes and templates. You're going to really kill that first project!

So when you see new concepts, stop the video, investigate, play with them,
and then keep going. Ultimately, looking inside some of Symfony's own classes
is a great way to get even more comfortable.

Ok let's roll!
