Introduction
============

Well hi again! And congrats on getting through everything in episode 1. Seriously,
that was a lot of work - so find a stranger and give them a high-five. Then
come back and let's get to work.

Over the next hour, we're going to take things to the next level, aiming
at some of the most difficult areas of Symfony, like security, forms, and
some serious Doctrine topics. Some of this stuff will look pretty tough at
first, but that's just because we're taking your Symfony foo up to the next
level. When you finish, you'll be another huge step towards mastering Symfony.

Ok, drink some coffee, stretch a little, and lets get to it!
