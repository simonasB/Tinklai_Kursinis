UPDATE
======

- mention the new simple_preauth somewhere
- LoginController -> SecurityController
- "login" route -> "login_form"

OLD
===


- in basic security I talk a lot about customizing error pages later. Where
    is this? Link to it!
- need to fix code for episode 1 - the composer file
- ability to ask questions or flag when you get confused so we can improve.
- put out a poll on our upcoming features and have people vote? Open-source
    our development plan and screencast plan? Open-source progress we have
    on features?
- any ability to see what a file should look like at a certain point? Instead
    of us just showing little tid-bits. For example, something like:
    
    .. code-block:: php

        :projectfile:`src/Yoda/EventBundle/Controller/EventController.php:4-7`
        // ...

        :projectfile:`src/Yoda/EventBundle/Controller/EventController.php:45-55`
- change calls to Symfony's class to :symfonyclass:
- add :doctrineclass:
- add :doctrinesource:
- some notes and tips will need to be code or video only:

    .. tip::
        :videoonly:
        :scriptonly:

- in registration-form, I tease form theming around line 244 - let's hook
    that up later
- in registration-form, I tease fixing the encoding password duplication
    in a future cast - 518
- in testing, on line 287, we talk about parameters.yml. But I don't know
    if we've taught this yet. Find where we teach this, link to it.
