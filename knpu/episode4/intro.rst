The Final Stretch
=================

Ok guys, welcome to the last episode. We'll be working on the project from 
where we left off in episode 3. You can get that from the code download on
this tutorial. I'm not going to bore you with a lot of introduction, I'd rather 
get to work. But I will say that you've come a long way through the first 3 episodes 
and you now understand all the really important parts of Symfony, like routes, controllers 
and services. Here in episode 4, we're going to round things out by learning more about 
forms, handling assets and how we can get our app up to production.

And hey, don't get lazy on me now. Code along with the tutorial - it'll make
a huge difference.

Ok, I can't wait any longer - let's go!
