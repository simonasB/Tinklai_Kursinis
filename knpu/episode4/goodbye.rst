Goodbye Friend!
===============

Young Jedi, now that you know how to deploy your application, why are you 
still listening to me?

Seriously, thanks for joining me, I'm excited to see what you'll build!
You've touched on just about every part of Symfony, including some more advanced
topics. So start coding!


Of course, you'll certainly run into new problems that will require new solutions.
When you do, be sure to check out Symfony's cookbook, which is packed with
articles on specific, and often much more advanced topics.

We also hope that you'll join us again in the future as we cover more PHP
and Symfony topics. Have an idea? We'd love to hear it.

Thank you, and see ya next time!
